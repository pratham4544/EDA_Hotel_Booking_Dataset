## Data Cleaning and Feature Engineering

### (1) Removing Duplicate rows
All duplicate rows were dropped.

### (2) Handling null values
- Null values in columns `company` and `agent` were replaced by 0.
- Null values in column `country` were replaced by 'others'.
- Null values in column `children` were replaced by the mean of the column.
  

### (3) Converting columns to appropriate data types

- Changed data type of `children`, `company`, `agent` to int type.
- Changed data type of `reservation_status_date` to date type.

### (4) Removing outliers

- One outlier was found in the `adr` column. Simply dropped it.

### (5) Creating new columns
- Created new column `days_stay` by adding `stays_in_weekend_nights`+`stays_in_week_nights`.
- Created new column `family_members` by adding `adults`+`children`+`babies`.

```
 Q1) Which agent makes the most no. of bookings?
 Q2) Which room type is in most demand and which room type generatesthe  highest adr?
 Q3) Which meal type isthe  most preffered meal of customers?

Mainly performed using Matplotlib and Seaborn library and the following graph and plots had been used:
  -  Bar Plot.
  -  Histogram.
   - Scatter Plot.
   - Pie Chart.
   - Line Plot.
   - Heatmap.
- Box Plot
             

## Conclusion

```
(1) most of business is getting from city hotel
(2) Business increase by transient customer has gave more
(3) Repat customer has low so we need to more invest in Ads and Marketing
(4) Our most of business coming from Travel agents are more likely 80% so it's dangerous and depedent
(5) Most of people prefer the single bed room and most of them are transients
(6) Our Portugal, Germenay & France these countries contribute almost 62% revenue
(7) Resort hotel are charge more than city hotels so that means transctions if lower in resort but comperatively they genrate more revenue.

```
## Challenges
```
(1) There was a lot of duplicate data.
(2) Data was present in wrong datatype format.
(3) Outliers are most presents
(4) data is not complete it is an incomplete by the month show not full in so it is an skew onsided
it shows that from 2015 to 2017 data has given but it may not had all the months are presnt
  -- in data 2015 had 6 months data available
  -- in 2016 the data had 12 months available 
  -- in 2017 the data has 8 months are avialble
so thats why it show some skewneess
